# Simulation-And-Modelling, Telephony network across a highway

## Project Description
The intent of this project is to simulate a telephony network across a highway. Calls and positions of calls are drawn from a random variate.
The distribution of the random variate is descbibed thoroughly in the report: Simulation & Modelling Report.pdf
Discrete-event simulation was used to simulate various calls passing through a highway.
The objective was to figure out what would be the best policy and if the company was able to pass the Quality of Service.

## Installation & Usage

The report can be found under Simulation & Modelling Report. 
The main.java file runs the program.
Simulation and Modelling.ipnyb file contains the input modelling and analysis. 
I used BlueJ to run the program files and still find it easier to use that as the IDE for the project. 

## Example of output
The following is an example of the output you should get after running the program

## Parameters
There are a variety of parameters such as number of cell towers and their capacity which can be found under class initalize. 
There are also a lot of random variate and distributions such as interarrival time and first call duration which can be found under the method call initiation inside class initalize.  
More information on the parameters and structure can be found in the report as mentioned before.
